**Convolution**

Purpose: Decomposing signals in terms of delayed impulses.

When an input 'x' goes into a system (LTI blackbox) it produces an output 'y'. y[n] is the considered to be the weighted sum of all the x[i] (i is from -inf to inf).

How are the weights defined for all of these impulses?
Every system has this function called an input response that defines how these weights are assigned. The definition of the impulse response is given as the response it gives for a dirac delta input.

Where is it used?
It is used in CNNs, in signal
